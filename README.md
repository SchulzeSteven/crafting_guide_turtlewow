### ✨ Overview

**BashyoCraftingGuide** is a lightweight World of Warcraft Classic / Turtle WoW addon designed to make profession management simple and powerful.  
It provides a central hub, automatic material calculations, and convenient access to trainer and shopping pages for every supported profession.

---

### ⚙️ Features

- 🧭 **Central Hub**  
  Access all supported professions from a single, clean interface.

- ⚙️ **Trainer & Shopping Pages**  
  Each profession includes a **Trainer** page for leveling guidance and a **Shopping** page to track required materials.

- 🧮 **Automatic Material Calculation**  
  Shopping lists **automatically calculate** how many materials you still need based on your **inventory** and **bank** contents.

- 💼 **Smart Bank Caching**  
  The addon caches your bank items every time you open the bank — and uses that data even when the bank is closed.

- 🪶 **Helpful Tooltips & Item Icons**  
  Hover over items to instantly see how they’re used and what you’re missing.

- 🧱 **Classic-Compatible Design**  
  Built for **WoW Classic** and **Turtle WoW**, fully compatible with Lua 5.0.

- 🪄 **Custom Interface**  
  Scrollable and movable UI, organized with tabs and accessible via:
